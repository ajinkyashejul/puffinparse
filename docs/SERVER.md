# PuffinParse gateway (`puffinparse serve`)

A small HTTP server in front of every provider PuffinParse supports, in the spirit of the LiteLLM
proxy: clients call one endpoint with one API shape and a gateway-issued key; the gateway holds
the provider keys, routes aliases to provider models with fallbacks, enforces per-key model
lists, monthly budgets and rate limits, and emits JSON-lines request logs and Prometheus metrics.

It is a thin layer over `puffinparse-core` (crate `crates/puffinparse-server`, axum + tower-http). It adds
no provider logic: every call is `puffinparse_core::parse / ocr / extract` with the request fields
below, so responses are exactly the unified types of [SPEC §5](SPEC.md#5-unified-responses), or
a vendor shape via `output_format` ([COMPAT.md](COMPAT.md)). Long documents can go through the
async jobs API instead (`POST /v1/jobs` + `GET /v1/jobs/{id}`, core `submit_parse` /
`retrieve_parse`, [SPEC §15](SPEC.md#15-asynchronous-jobs-and-webhooks)), so no connection is held
open while the provider works.

## Run it

```bash
export PUFFINPARSE_MASTER_KEY=sk-master-change-me
export PUFFINPARSE_KEY_BILLING=sk-billing-change-me PUFFINPARSE_KEY_RESEARCH=sk-research-change-me
export REDUCTO_API_KEY=... EXTEND_API_KEY=... LLAMA_API_KEY=...
puffinparse serve --config examples/server/puffinparse.toml          # --host / --port override the file
```

Without `--config` it reads `./puffinparse.toml` if present (or `$PUFFINPARSE_CONFIG`), else runs with
defaults: `127.0.0.1:4000`, no aliases, **no auth** (a warning is printed). On any address other
than loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`, `localhost`) the gateway **refuses to start** without a
`master_key` or `[[keys]]`, unless `server.allow_unauthenticated = true` says something in front
of it already authenticates every caller.

The defaults are meant for a gateway that untrusted callers can reach; see
[Hardening](#hardening) for what they do and how to loosen them. Terminate TLS in front of it.

Docker (multi-stage build, distroless runtime, runs as non-root). Releases publish the image to
`ghcr.io/ajinkyashejul/puffinparse` (tags `latest`, the version such as `0.1.2`, and `0.1`). From the
next release it is multi-arch (linux/amd64 and linux/arm64), so Apple Silicon and Graviton hosts
pull a native image; releases up to 0.1.6 are linux/amd64 only, so pass `--platform linux/amd64` for
those, or build it yourself with `docker build -t puffinparse .`. Licence files are in
`/usr/share/doc/puffinparse/`. The image contains no self-hosted engines (Tesseract,
Docling, PaddleOCR): use it for the hosted providers, or build an image that adds them.

```bash
docker run --rm -p 4000:4000 -v $PWD/examples/server/puffinparse.toml:/etc/puffinparse/puffinparse.toml:ro \
  -e PUFFINPARSE_MASTER_KEY -e PUFFINPARSE_KEY_BILLING -e PUFFINPARSE_KEY_RESEARCH \
  -e REDUCTO_API_KEY -e EXTEND_API_KEY -e LLAMA_API_KEY ghcr.io/ajinkyashejul/puffinparse
```

The image's default command is `serve --host 0.0.0.0 --config /etc/puffinparse/puffinparse.toml`; it exits
if no config is mounted, or if the config defines no `master_key` / `[[keys]]`, rather than serving
an open gateway.

## Configuration (`puffinparse.toml`)

Every secret may be written as `"env:VAR"`, resolved once at startup. A virtual key or master key
whose reference resolves to nothing is a startup error (fail closed); a provider key that resolves
to nothing prints a warning and the core falls back to the provider's default env var.

```toml

```

A complete sample is [`examples/server/puffinparse.toml`](../examples/server/puffinparse.toml).

**Routing.** `model` is looked up as an alias first, then (if `allow_direct_models`) as a registry
model (`reducto/standard`, or a bare provider for its default model in that mode). A self-hosted
engine (`tesseract`, `docling`, `paddleocr`, `vllm`) named directly is only served to a key whose
`models` names it (`"tesseract/*"`, `"docling/default"`; `"*"` and an empty list do not count), to
the master key, or with `allow_local_engines = true`; behind an alias it is served to any key
allowed that alias. An alias expands
to its targets: `ordered` always starts at the first, `round_robin` rotates the start per request,
and both fall back in order when the error kind is in `fallback_on`. A request's own `fallbacks`
list is appended after that (aliases expand in order). Every target is checked against the
endpoint's mode before any provider is called. Target-level `api_key` / `base_url` override the
`[providers.*]` ones, so two deployments of the same provider (two accounts, two regions) can sit
behind one alias. When a fallback served the call, the response metadata carries
`puffinparse_fallback_index` and `puffinparse_fallback_from_error`, as with the SDK `Router`.

**Budgets.** Spend is the response's `cost_usd` (provider-reported cost when available, otherwise
the list-price estimate from `pricing.json`), summed per key per UTC calendar month. The check runs
before the call: a key whose spend has reached its budget gets `402`. One in-flight request can take
a key past its budget; nothing is charged for failed attempts (a provider may still bill a failed
job). An async job is charged to the key that submitted it, once, when it is first observed
succeeded (by `GET /v1/jobs/{id}` or a webhook); submitting and polling are free. State is in
memory; with `state_file` it (spend, counts and submitted jobs) is rewritten (temp file + rename)
after every change and reloaded on startup. Rate-limit windows are not persisted.

## API

Authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `x-api-key: <key>`. Send `x-request-id` to
choose the request id (echoed in the `x-request-id` response header and the log), otherwise a
UUID is generated.

### `POST /v1/parse`, `POST /v1/ocr`, `POST /v1/extract`

Body is JSON or `multipart/form-data` with the same field names (multipart fields are text; the
JSON-valued ones — `provider_options`, `schema`, `metadata`, `fallbacks` — are JSON strings, and
`fallbacks` may also be comma-separated).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | string | **Required.** Alias or `provider/model`. |
| `document_url` | string | Public http(s) URL. Passed to the provider where it accepts URLs; for the other models it is rejected (400) unless `server.fetch_document_urls` is on, and then downloaded by the gateway with address filtering ([Hardening](#hardening)). |
| `document` | string | Base64 bytes (a `data:…;base64,` prefix is accepted). Needs `filename`. |
| `file` | multipart file part | The upload; its filename sets the type (or send `filename`). |
| `filename` | string | Sets the MIME type for `document` / overrides the part's filename. |
| `pages`, `language` | string | As in SPEC §4.1. |
| `output` | `"markdown"` \| `"text"` | Block content format (parse). |
| `output_format` | `"reducto"` \| `"extend"` \| `"llamaparse"` \| `"puffinparse"` | Vendor-native response shape (parse, extract). |
| `provider_options` | object | Merged into the provider request verbatim. |
| `include_raw` | bool | Attach the provider payload as `raw`. |
| `timeout` | number (s) | Capped at `server.max_timeout_secs`. |
| `max_retries` | int | Per provider call (max 10). |
| `fallbacks` | string[] | Extra aliases/models tried after `model`'s own targets. |
| `metadata` | object | Echoed back in the response. |
| `schema`, `instructions`, `citations` | | `/v1/extract` only; `schema` required there. |

Exactly one of `document_url`, `document`, `file`. `api_key` and `base_url` are **rejected**: a
client must never be able to point the gateway's provider credentials at another host. Local file
paths are not accepted either.

The response is the unified `ParseResponse` / `TextResponse` / `ExtractResponse` JSON (or the
vendor shape), with headers `x-puffinparse-model` (served model), `x-puffinparse-cost-usd`, `x-request-id`.

### `POST /v1/jobs`, `GET /v1/jobs/{id}` (async parse)

`POST /v1/jobs` takes the `/v1/parse` body (JSON or multipart, same fields) plus an optional
`webhook_url`, uploads the document, starts the provider job and answers **202** at once:

```json
{"id": "job_4f0c…", "object": "job", "status": "pending",
 "job": {"provider": "reducto", "model": "reducto/standard", "job_id": "c1e2…",
         "submitted_at": "2026-09-24T20:23:52.140Z", "output": "markdown", "include_raw": false}}
```

`job` is the core `JobHandle` (SPEC §15) minus the operator's `base_url`. Authentication, the
key's model allow-list, aliases, the budget pre-check and `rpm` apply exactly as for
`/v1/parse`. Only providers with a job queue can take jobs (`reducto`, `extend`, `llamaparse`,
`opendocrouter`; others give `400 unsupported_model_error`). **Fallback does not apply to jobs**: an alias submits
to its first target (in `round_robin`, the next one in rotation) and a request `fallbacks` list is
rejected, because a provider failure only shows up later, on retrieve. `webhook_url` is
forwarded to the provider's per-job webhook (Reducto `async.webhook`, LlamaParse `webhook_url`;
Extend and OpenDocRouter reject it) and is refused by the synchronous endpoints.

`GET /v1/jobs/{id}` asks the provider once and returns

```json
{"id": "job_4f0c…", "object": "job", "status": "pending" | "succeeded" | "failed",
 "model": "reducto/standard", "provider": "reducto", "provider_job_id": "c1e2…",
 "submitted_at": "…", "result": {…ParseResponse…}, "error": {…error object…}}
```

with `result` only when `succeeded` (the unified `ParseResponse`, or the vendor shape for the
`output_format` sent at submit time; `?output_format=reducto` overrides it per call) and `error`
only when `failed` (the same object as an error body's `error`, with the provider's message and
`job_id`). A failed *job* is still HTTP 200; a failed *status check* (provider credentials,
network) is an error response as usual. Job ids are opaque and bound to the key that created the
job: any other key gets `404 not_found`, exactly as for an unknown id (the master key can read all
jobs). Polls count toward the key's `rpm` but are not budget-gated. The job's cost is charged to
its owner once, the first time it is seen succeeded. Credentials are resolved from the config on
every poll (the alias target's own key, else `[providers.*]`), never stored; handles are kept for
`job_retention_hours` (and in `state_file` when set).

### `POST /v1/webhooks/{provider}` (optional)

Off by default (404). With `[webhooks] enabled = true` and a `secret`, the gateway accepts the
body a provider POSTs when a job changes state — Reducto direct webhooks, Extend `parse_run.*`
events, LlamaCloud `parse.*` events — authenticated by `?token=<secret>` or the
`x-puffinparse-webhook-secret` header (compared in constant time). The body is read with core
`parse_webhook`; when it only says the job finished, the gateway makes one status check. The
provider's job id must match a job submitted through this gateway (else 404); a success is
charged to the job's owner (once, shared with `GET`), and the answer is an acknowledgement
`{"ids": [...], "status"}` — clients still collect the result with `GET /v1/jobs/{id}`. `ids` can
hold several gateway jobs: LlamaParse returns the same (cached) job id for an identical upload, so
two submissions of the same file share one provider job, and each is settled and charged to its
own key. Point a provider's
webhook at `https://<gateway>/v1/webhooks/reducto?token=<secret>` (per job via `webhook_url`, or a
workspace-level endpoint for Extend / LlamaCloud). This is a shared secret, not the vendors' HMAC
signatures: keep the URL private and serve the gateway over TLS. A LlamaParse `webhook_url`
result push that names no job id cannot be attributed and is rejected with 400.

### Errors

Every error has the same body:

```json
{"error": {"type": "provider_error", "message": "…the provider's own message…", "provider": "reducto",
           "provider_status": 503, "job_id": null, "request_id": "5c0f…"}}
```

| HTTP | `type` | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `input_error`, `bad_request_error`, `unsupported_model_error` | Malformed request, provider 4xx, unknown model or model without this mode |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | Missing or unknown gateway key |
| 402 | `budget_exceeded` | Key's monthly budget spent |
| 403 | `model_not_allowed` | Model (or a fallback) not in the key's `models`, or a self-hosted engine the key may not name |
| 404 | `not_found` | Unknown job id, a job another key owns, or webhooks disabled |
| 413 | `payload_too_large` | Body over `max_body_mb` |
| 429 | `key_rate_limited` | Key's `rpm` reached (`Retry-After` set) |
| 429 | `rate_limit_error` | Provider rate limit after retries and fallbacks |
| 502 | `provider_error`, `network_error`, `authentication_error` | Provider 5xx / failed job, network failure, provider rejected the gateway's credentials |
| 504 | `timeout_error` | `timeout` exceeded, or the gateway's own `request_timeout_secs` |

Provider credential failures are 502, not 401: the caller's key was fine, the operator's was not.

### `GET /v1/models`

Aliases (targets, strategy, the modes every target supports) and, with `allow_direct_models`,
every registry model with its modes, per-page list price per mode and whether a provider key is
configured. Filtered to what the caller's key may use.

### `GET /v1/usage`

This month's spend, requests, pages, remaining budget and limits: the caller's own key, or all
keys for the master key.

### `GET /health`, `GET /metrics`

`/health` → `{"status": "ok", "version": …}` (no auth). `/metrics` is Prometheus text and needs a
gateway key (any virtual key or the master key; give the scraper its own `[[keys]]` entry) unless
`server.public_metrics = true`. It carries model names, counts and costs, no secrets or content:

| Metric | Labels |
|---|---|
| `puffinparse_requests_total` | `mode`, `model` (served model, or requested alias on failure, `-` if it never resolved), `status` |
| `puffinparse_errors_total` | `type` (the error `type` above) |
| `puffinparse_request_duration_seconds` (histogram, 0.25 s – 300 s buckets) | `mode` |
| `puffinparse_pages_total` | `model` |
| `puffinparse_cost_usd_total` | `model` |
| `puffinparse_fallbacks_total` | — |
| `puffinparse_jobs_total` | `event`: `submitted`, and `succeeded` / `failed` the first time a job is seen terminal |

`mode` is `parse` / `ocr` / `extract` for the synchronous endpoints and `job_submit`,
`job_retrieve`, `webhook` for the jobs API, so job latencies do not mix with blocking calls. A
job's pages and cost are counted once, when it is first seen succeeded.

### Playground API (`/v1/playground/*`, optional)

Off by default (404). With `[playground] enabled = true` the gateway serves the website's
[`/playground/`](../website/playground/index.html) page: a browser uploads one document, picks up
to three models and polls one job per model. It is a thin layer over the jobs API above: a run is
one core `submit_parse` per model, stored as a gateway job, and the browser polls
`GET /v1/jobs/{id}`. There are two ways to pay, never mixed in one request:

- **Free tier**: `Authorization: Bearer <Supabase access token>` (GitHub or email sign-in on the
  page) plus a Cloudflare Turnstile token. The gateway's own provider keys pay, so a run first
  reserves `pages x models` of the user's daily model-pages (`free_model_pages_per_day`; released
  if a submit fails, trued up to the provider's page count on success), the day's free spend must
  be under `free_daily_budget_usd` (each job's cost is added once, on its first success), and only
  models priced at or under `free_tier_max_price_per_page` are offered. A PDF whose pages the
  gateway cannot count is refused on the free tier.
- **Your own keys**: one `x-provider-key-<provider>` header per provider (`reducto`, `extend`,
  `llamaparse`, `opendocrouter`) and no `Authorization` header. The key goes to that provider for
  this request and its polls only; the gateway never falls back to its own key for such a run. The
  key is never stored, logged or written to `state_file`; the jobs it creates are owned by an HMAC
  of the key under a random per-process secret, so only the same key can read them and nothing
  about the key survives a restart.

```toml
[playground]
enabled = false
allowed_origins = ["https://puffinparse.com"]   # CORS: exact origins, no credentials
models = ["reducto/standard", "reducto/r-1", "extend/parse_light", "llamaparse/fast",
          "llamaparse/cost_effective", "llamaparse/agentic"]   # providers with a job queue
free_tier_max_price_per_page = 0.025           # USD list price; dearer models are own-key only
max_file_mb = 4
max_pages = 10                                 # per document, counted by the gateway
max_models = 3
free_model_pages_per_day = 30                  # per signed-in user, UTC day
free_daily_budget_usd = 0.0                    # all users together; 0 = free tier paused
ip_rpm = 20                                    # runs per minute per client IP (both tiers)
poll_rpm = 120                                 # job status checks per minute per user / key
trust_forwarded_for = 0                        # proxies in front that append X-Forwarded-For (Cloud Run: 1)
turnstile_secret = "env:TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY"  # the free tier is off without it

[playground.supabase]
url = "https://<project>.supabase.co"          # JWKS, issuer and the counters' RPC derive from it
service_key = "env:SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY"        # counters in Supabase (infra/supabase/); unset = in memory
# jwt_secret = "env:SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET"       # legacy HS256 projects only
# audience = ["authenticated"]  leeway_secs = 30  jwks_cache_secs = 600
```

The free tier is available only with `[playground.supabase]`, `turnstile_secret` and
`free_daily_budget_usd > 0`. Without `service_key` its counters live in the process (one instance
only; they reset on restart); with it they are the `security definer` functions of
[`infra/supabase/`](../infra/supabase/migrations/20261008000000_playground_quota.sql), callable only
by the service role. Access tokens are verified against the project's JWKS (cached, refetched on an
unknown `kid`), with `exp`, `aud` and `iss` checked and anonymous sessions refused. The client IP
for `ip_rpm` is the connection's address, or with `trust_forwarded_for = N` the N-th
`X-Forwarded-For` entry from the right (IPv6 is limited per /64).

**`GET /v1/playground/config`** (optional bearer) answers what the page may offer right now:

```json
{"limits": {"max_file_bytes": 4194304, "accepted_types": ["application/pdf", "image/png", "image/jpeg"],
            "models_per_run": 3, "pages_per_run": 10, "model_pages_per_day": 30},
 "free_tier": {"available": true, "reason": null, "user": {"model_pages_remaining": 27}},
 "byok": {"available": true},
 "models": [{"id": "reducto/standard", "provider": "reducto", "provider_name": "Reducto", "model": "standard",
             "price_per_page_usd": 0.015, "free_tier": true, "byok": true}]}
```

`free_tier.reason` is `budget_exhausted` or `paused` when `available` is false; `user` is set only
for a valid bearer. **`POST /v1/playground/runs`** is multipart: `file` (PDF, PNG or JPEG, checked
by magic bytes; providers get a generic filename, never the user's), `models` (repeated, 1 to
`max_models`, distinct), and `turnstile_token` on the free tier. The gateway counts the pages,
reserves model-pages (free tier), submits one job per model concurrently and answers **202**:

```json
{"id": "pgrun_…", "object": "playground_run", "mode": "free" | "byok", "pages": 2,
 "jobs": [{"model": "reducto/standard", "id": "job_…", "status": "pending", "error": null},
          {"model": "extend/parse_light", "id": null, "status": "failed", "error": {"type": "provider_error", "message": "…"}}],
 "usage": {"model_pages_remaining": 21}}
```

A model whose submit failed comes back `failed` with its error and its model-pages are given back.
Poll each `id` with `GET /v1/jobs/{id}` and the same auth headers as the submit: the signed-in
user who ran it (free tier) or the same provider key (own keys); anyone else gets 404, exactly as
for an unknown job. The master key can read a free-tier job, but not poll an own-key job (the
gateway has no key for it). Polls are limited by `poll_rpm` per user or key. Besides the errors
above:

| HTTP | `type` | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `too_many_models`, `too_many_pages` | Over `max_models` / `max_pages` (`details.limit`, `details.pages`) |
| 400 | `missing_provider_key` | Own-key run without a key for a chosen model's provider (`details.provider`) |
| 400 | `input_error` | Both a bearer and provider keys, a model listed twice, or an uncountable PDF on the free tier |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | Neither a bearer nor provider keys, or an invalid / expired access token |
| 403 | `turnstile_failed` | Free tier without a valid Turnstile token |
| 403 | `model_not_allowed` | Model not in `[playground] models`, or above the free-tier price |
| 413 | `payload_too_large` | File over `max_file_mb` |
| 415 | `unsupported_media_type` | Not a PDF, PNG or JPEG |
| 429 | `quota_exceeded` | The user's daily model-pages would be passed (`details.requested`, `details.remaining`, `details.limit`) |
| 429 | `ip_rate_limited` | `ip_rpm` reached (`Retry-After` set) |
| 503 | `free_tier_unavailable` | Day's budget spent or free tier off (`details.reason`: `budget_exhausted`, `paused`, `unavailable`) |

Error bodies may carry `details` (an object) next to `message`. The request log records `key_id` as
`playground:free:<hash of the user id>` or `playground:byok`; it never records the document, the
output, a provider key, the access token or the Turnstile token. Documents are held in memory only
for the submit. CORS (`allowed_origins`, no credentials) applies to the two playground routes and
`GET /v1/jobs/{id}` only; the rest of the API is not opened to browsers.

## Hardening

What the defaults do, and the setting that loosens each one. Changing a default is a deliberate
choice for a gateway whose callers you trust.

| Concern | Default | Setting |
|---|---|---|
| Open gateway | Refuses to start on a non-loopback host without `master_key` / `[[keys]]` | `allow_unauthenticated` |
| `document_url` downloaded by the gateway | Rejected with 400 for models whose provider cannot fetch URLs | `fetch_document_urls` |
| Where those downloads may connect | Public addresses only | `allow_private_document_urls` |
| Download size | 50 MiB | `max_download_mb` |
| Self-hosted engines | Only via an alias, a key that names them, or the master key | `allow_local_engines` |
| `/metrics` | Needs a gateway key | `public_metrics` |
| Concurrent document requests | 64; more wait for a slot | `max_concurrent_requests` |
| One HTTP request | `max_timeout_secs` + 60 s, slot wait included, then 504 | `request_timeout_secs` |
| Slow request headers | Connection closed after 30 s | `header_read_timeout_secs` |
| Request body | 50 MiB, 413 above | `max_body_mb` |
| Public playground routes | Off (404); with it on, the free tier stays off until Supabase, Turnstile and a budget are set | `[playground]` |

**Which models download `document_url` in the gateway.** Tesseract, Docling, PaddleOCR, vLLM,
Unstructured, Textract, Gemini, the OpenAI and Anthropic vision models, Upstage, Document AI, and
LlamaParse in `extract` mode: their APIs take bytes (or, for the self-hosted engines, their server
sits on your network), so the gateway would fetch the URL itself. With `fetch_document_urls =
false` (the default) such a request is answered `400 input_error` naming the setting, before any
provider is called, and also when only one of an alias's targets or a request `fallbacks` entry
would download. Reducto, Extend, LlamaParse parse, Mistral, Azure, Datalab, Mathpix, Landing AI
and OpenDocRouter fetch URLs on their side and take `document_url` as before. The list is
`puffinparse_core::fetch::fetches_url_in_process`.

**When the gateway does download** (`fetch_document_urls = true`), it uses the core's restricted
fetch ([SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#document-urls)): http(s) only; the host is resolved by the
gateway and loopback, private, link-local (`169.254.169.254`), CGNAT, unique-local, multicast and
reserved addresses are refused, the connection is pinned to the checked address, at most 5
redirects each re-checked, `max_download_mb`, the request's deadline, no response body in errors.
`allow_private_document_urls` lifts the address check; the process's
`PUFFINPARSE_ALLOW_PRIVATE_URLS` / `PUFFINPARSE_MAX_DOWNLOAD_MB` variables are ignored by the
gateway.

**`allow_direct_models` stays `true` by default**: the quickstart, the sample config
(`llamaparse/*` for the `research` key) and the curl examples name registry models directly. With
it on, a key with an empty `models` list may call every provider the gateway has credentials for,
so give each key an explicit `models` list (or set `allow_direct_models = false` to serve aliases
only).

Also: provider keys and virtual keys are never logged, and the gateway's `Debug` output redacts
them; clients cannot send `api_key`, `base_url`, a local path, or the `provider_options` that pick
a program on the server (`cmd`, `pdftoppm_cmd`).

## Request log

One JSON object per request, on stdout and/or `log_file`:

```json
{"ts":"2026-09-24T20:23:52.140Z","request_id":"bf397168-…","key_id":"demo","method":"POST",
 "path":"/v1/parse","mode":"parse","model":"cheap","served_model":"llamaparse/cost_effective",
 "provider":"llamaparse","fallback_index":0,"pages":1,"cost_usd":0.00375,"latency_ms":10384,
 "status":200,"error_type":null,"provider_status":null}
```

Jobs API lines add `job_id` (the gateway id) and `job_status` (`pending` / `succeeded` /
`failed`, as observed by that request); `method` is `GET` for status checks, and `key_id` is
`webhook` for provider webhooks. `pages` and `cost_usd` are set only on the request that charged
the job.

The record has no field for document bytes, URLs, extracted content, provider error text (some
providers echo document text in errors), provider keys or gateway key secrets.

## curl examples

```bash
GW=http://127.0.0.1:4000; KEY=sk-billing-change-me

# Upload a file (multipart) to an alias
curl -s $GW/v1/parse -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -F model=invoices -F file=@invoice.pdf | jq .markdown

# URL input, vendor-native shape, a request-level fallback
curl -s $GW/v1/parse -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "model": "invoices", "document_url": "https://example.com/invoice.pdf",
  "output_format": "reducto", "fallbacks": ["llamaparse/cost_effective"]}'

# Base64 input, OCR mode
curl -s $GW/v1/ocr -H "x-api-key: $KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"model\": \"reducto\", \"filename\": \"scan.png\", \"document\": \"$(base64 -w0 scan.png)\"}" | jq .text

# Extract with a schema
curl -s $GW/v1/extract -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -F model=invoice-fields -F file=@invoice.pdf \
  -F 'schema={"type":"object","properties":{"total":{"type":"number"}}}'

# Async job: submit, then poll until status is succeeded or failed
JOB=$(curl -s $GW/v1/jobs -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -F model=invoices -F file=@big.pdf | jq -r .id)
curl -s $GW/v1/jobs/$JOB -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" | jq .status
curl -s "$GW/v1/jobs/$JOB?output_format=reducto" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" | jq .result

curl -s $GW/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" | jq '.data[].id'
curl -s $GW/v1/usage  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
curl -s $GW/metrics  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"     # or server.public_metrics = true
```

## Not in scope (yet)

Streaming, jobs for `ocr` / `extract` (jobs are parse-only, like the core), fallback for jobs,
the gateway registering its own webhook URL with providers automatically, vendor HMAC signature
checks on webhooks, key management over HTTP (keys live in the config file; restart to change them), a database, response
caching, per-key budgets by model, TLS termination (put it behind a reverse proxy), and per-IP
rate limits (use the reverse proxy).
